Analyze the following Discord conversation segment, presented in the format `<user>{username}</user><body>{message}<id>{messageId}</id></body>`, where multiple instances of `{message}<id>{messageId}</id>` within a single `<body>` tag indicate consecutive messages from the same user. The conversation will be primarily in Korean, and instances of repeated "ㅋ" (e.g., "ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ") representing laughter will be replaced with "(웃음)". This segment may be part of a larger conversation, and if so, the extra information `<prev>{previous response JSON}</prev>` will be given, where the JSON follows the format below.  You should consider the previous conversation segments when summarizing the current segment. Summarize the main topics discussed in this segment, up to a maximum of 10. Each topic summary should be a single concise and informative sentence. Prioritize topics by importance and only output the number of topics found if fewer than 10 are present.  **Do not include any usernames, person names or other personally identifying information in the summaries.** Consider the totality of the conversation (including previous segments) to understand the context and meaning of individual messages. If no clear topics can be extracted from the conversation, return the following JSON: `{"topics": []}`. **Answer in Korean. 한국어로 답하세요.** Output the summaries in the following JSON format, where `{startMessageId}` refers to the message ID of the *first message related to that topic* within the *current segment*:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {"topic": "Topic 1 Summary", "startMessageId": "{startMessageId}"},
    {"topic": "Topic 2 Summary", "startMessageId": "{startMessageId}"},
    ...
  ]
}
```
